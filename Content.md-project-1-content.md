# Parrot Party
## Content
While rapidly smashing on the dancing parrot, you gain hype in order to get an increased number of party parrots, of all different designs. As you gain more hype, you unlock the ability to hype the part up even more.

## Genre
Parrot Party is a casual clicker rpg where the goal is to click the partying parrot in order to gain hype, allowing you to upgrade your party center to then increase the hype more.

## Platform
Parrot Party is desktop focused with a mobile-friendly design so that it can be played through a browser on either a phone or computer.

## Story
The story of the game is that the main party parrot, which is the one the player is clicking, is trying to gain hype for his party, so more friends show up. As you click he gains hype, to purchase new things for his party location, attracting more parrots to come join the party. The game is meant to excite and relax the player. The small rewards are the RPG style rewards that are able to be bought by the player using hype they gain, to keep rewarding the player with small things to keep them invested and feeling like they are progressing.

## Esthetics
The game will be done in a pixel-art style, with techno music as the main style of music, however there will be options to change the style as the player progresses through the game. Each click will give off a small beat depending on the soundtrack that is playing in the background. Overall the soundtrack and effects overall will be EDM and Techno focused.

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The choices a player can make mostly involve upgrades for the parrot and the party that the parrot is hosting. This involves things like type of guests, music, decorations, hats for the players parrots, and other rewards like that to keep the player invested and feel like they are improving as they go.
### Control
The main control scheme for the desktoip version is clicking as well as using the spacebar so that the game is more accessible. For mobile users on browser it will be interactable through touch so that it is simple and easy to use.
### Onboarding the Player
The game will follow the style and design of most other types of games in the clicker genre and will make it pretty easy to onboard a new user because it is similar to other games they have played.
### Player Learning
There is no real winning state for the game besides getting all of the upgrades and getting the max amount of hype rate that the player can get. Overall the increase in 'power' that the player achieves is through upgrades to the party space, the parrot itself such ashats, and the type of music being played, all of which increase the rate of hype gain.
## Screenshots
